"# Brutus" 

- modularity

- reusable but replacable : gain as much as possible from external libraries but allow to replace any
                            functionality easilly
- tests : GoogleTest

- methodology : Concept Driven Development - pure TDD is too formal and strict process and
                many functionalities to be implemented are more like research than already
                defined algorithms. More like abstract ideas. To prove that they are correct
                need to narrow down time from idea to check how it works. C++ is not perfect
                for this, Python is, but try to achieve this with latest C++ standard is kind
                of challenge.
